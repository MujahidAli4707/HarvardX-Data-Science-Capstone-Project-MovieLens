# Movielens Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Movielens Movie Recommendation System, a machine learning project developed as part of the HarvardX Data Science Capstone Course. The goal of the project is to create a robust movie recommender system using the Movielens dataset, which includes over 10 million ratings.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Movielens 10M Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/10m/), provided by the GroupLens research group at the University of Minnesota.

## Methodology
The project follows a structured approach, starting with data preparation, followed by model development, and concluding with model evaluation. Various machine learning techniques have been employed, ranging from simple linear regression to advanced methods like regularized linear models and ensemble methods.

## Repository Structure
- `Data/`: Contains the Movielens dataset files.
- `Scripts/`: R scripts for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Notebooks/`: R Markdown files detailing the project methodology and findings.
- `Results/`: Graphs and summaries of model evaluations.
- `Documentation/`: Additional resources and documentation.

## Models Developed
- Simple Linear Model
- Regularized Linear Model
- Advanced Regularized Linear Model
- Ensemble Model combining GLM, RF, and Loess predictions

## Usage
To run the project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required R packages listed in `Scripts/requirements.R`.
3. Run the R scripts in the `Scripts/` directory, following the order specified in `Scripts/README.md`.

## Results
The models' performance has been evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric, with detailed results available in the `Results/` directory.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or open issues to suggest improvements or discuss modifications.
